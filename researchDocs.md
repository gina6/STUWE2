# UX Research Documentation for "The Faster One"

##Introduction
For a course of the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts, the "The Faster One" UX team has been working on testing "The Faster One"’s user experience.
<br><br>
In short our focus was on:
1. Does the game and all its functions work as intended?
2. Is the game easy to understand?
3. Is the game fun to play?
### Background 
"The Faster One" is inspired by the classic wooden maze puzzle game, as seen in the picture below. 
The goal of the game is to navigate the ball in to the right hole to score a point. 
To control the ball, just tilt your connected smartphone which is using the device's gyroscope. 
It's a browser based single and multiplayer game – 1-4 Players. 
The setup to play would be: Use any device (e.g. Smart TV, Laptop, … it just needs an internet browser) as a screen and one or more smartphones as controllers.

##Research Questions

###For an overview, all the research questions and summarized results from the latest tested variant:

| Topic | Question | Priority | Current Research Findings | Further Steps |
|-------|----------|----------|---------------------------|---------------|
| Accessibility | Is it usable for people with restricted mobility (hand/arm) | low | Testing needed with users with restricted mobility   | " |
| Accessibility | Is it usable for people with impaired vision (e.g. color, contrast) | low | Not optimal | requires game settings to optimize colors for people with visual color impairment – further testing |
| Onboarding of the player(s) | Can the player(s) join a game via the QR code | high | Yes, never was a problem | none |
| Onboarding of the player(s) | Is an additional number/word code needed | high | No | none |
| Control mechanisms of the game | Can they use the phones gyro sensor to yaw, pitch & roll to move the ball working – on AndroidOS and iOS | high | Yes, on AndroidOS there where no problems during the tests; iOS could not be tested (not yet implemented) | Test for iOS |
| Control mechanisms of the game | Need for buttons as an alternative | medium | No, not for people without restricted mobility | Testing needed with users with restricted mobility |
| Control mechanisms of the game | Is the standard sensitivity working for everyone or is there a need to adjust it | medium | The given setting was not sensitive enough; Users should not be able to change by themselves (for the game balance) | Increase sensitivity – further testing with new setting |
| Control mechanisms of the game | How will they hold the mobile device instinctively | medium | Portrait mode | none |
| Functionalities of the game | Can they start a game | high | Yes, no problems occurred | none |
| Functionalities of the game | Do they figure out how to win/how to score a point | high |Yes | none |
| Functionalities of the game | Can they read the points scored and time left in a game (In single and multiplayer) | high | Yes | none |
| Functionalities of the game | Can they switch between single and multiplayer mode | high | Yes | none |
| Functionalities of the game | Is there a need to change the game duration and or the winning score | low | Yes | Create ingame settings – test those |
| Functionalities of the game | Can they restart the game | high | Yes | none |
| Functionalities of the game | Can they exit to the main menu | high | Yes | none |
| Functionalities of the game | Is it fun for them to play in single player | low | Not in the current mode | Further adjustments needed – test those |
| Functionalities of the game | Is it fun for them to play in multiplayer | low | Yes | none |
| Functionalities of the game | How do they like it – atmosphere, sounds etc. | low | Overall yes, sound not yet implemented | Further tests necessary, with the finalized version |
| Functionalities of the game | Does the player know who won (multiplayer) | high | Yes | none |
| Functionalities of the game | Do they understand the leaderboard (multiplayer) | medium | Yes | none |



## Summarized, the results of the main objectives:
* Does the game and all its functions work as intended?
  * Overall yes, but it needs still further improvements here and there
* Is the game easy to understand?
  * Yes, but there is still further testing needed with the upcoming revised versions
* Is the game fun to play?
  * Yes, at least in multiplayer mode. Single player was not fun for the testet individuals in the current version. We need to further adjust the single player mode.

## Design Concept, Wireframes & Prototypes
The design concept, the wireframes and the prototypes in all its iterations can be viewed in the Figma file here:
[https://www.figma.com/file/SvU34EUYjpnpFq1tZPvfUH/STUWEUX2?node-id=0%3A1](https://www.figma.com/file/SvU34EUYjpnpFq1tZPvfUH/STUWEUX2?node-id=548%3A777)

## User Research
The user tests were performed in five iterations. After each iteration, the feedback was given to the designers and programmers to implement the analyzed results.
The first to third test was conducted internally with four colleagues to review the initial design ideas. For the fourth and fifth test we used overall seven external test participants, which met the criteria listed in the next section below.

### Participant Description
Test participants should have some technical knowledge with a smartphone. Should have played games before – mobile games is fine. German or English speaking. Age or gender irrelevant but at best balanced.
